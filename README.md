# calendar-gen

Scripts to generate yearly, monthly and weekly sheets for tracking of key periodic tasks (such as achieving daily sleep goals and daily exercise). Generates as HTML, intended to be printed on A4 page, without header and footer data. I tape them to a board and pyhsically write check marks.

NOTE: the scripts generate month and week names in Slovenian, they also mark Slovenian holidays - they require adaptations for use by citizens of other coutries. Week numbers are by ISO 8601 standard.

# FAQ

## Why physical paper? There's an app for that!

Of course there's an app for that, but the app requires:
- unlocking the phone,
- navigating to the app,
- navigating the app UI to appropriate place,
- placing the completion marker.

On the other hand, paper requires:
- taking a pen from the holder on the board,
- ticking the appropriate boxes.

I didn't want to complicate already tedious routine task with any more bureaucracy than strictly neccessary.

## Why not interactive page? Why CLI script?

Planned.
